## The Core Insight

**In 2026, developer tool marketing operates on fundamentally different principles than traditional marketing:**

Traditional approach: Build backlinks, optimize for keywords, run ads

Developer tool approach: Build authentic community, document comprehensively, engage where developers naturally gather (GitHub, Reddit, HN)

**Why this matters:** Google and AI systems now treat Reddit and GitHub discussions as authoritative sources for technical queries. This means your marketing strategy should be 70% community/content focused, 30% traditional SEO.

## Common Questions

### Q: Should I spend money on ads?
**A:** Not initially. Developer tools succeed through organic/earned channels first. Use ads only after product-market fit.

### Q: How long until I see results?
**A:**
- Week 1: GitHub optimization complete
- Month 1: 100+ stars, initial community engagement
- Month 3: 500+ stars, community established
- Quarter 1: 1000+ stars, sustainable growth

### Q: Which channel is most important?
**A:** GitHub. It's the default "app store" for developers. Optimize it first.

### Q: Do I need to be on every platform?
**A:** No. Focus on 2-3 channels where your audience naturally gathers. For most developer tools: GitHub + Reddit + one of (Hacker News, Product Hunt, or Dev.to).

### Q: What if my tool is commercial/paid?
**A:** Same strategy. Build trust through freemium/free tier, documentation, community engagement. Sales comes after you've built credibility.

### Q: How do I stand out with so much competition?
**A:** Through authentic technical depth and comprehensive documentation. Most tools have poor docs. Yours won't.
