## Key Themes Across Research

### 1. **Authentication Over Marketing**
- Developers detect and distrust marketing language
- Technical depth, transparency, and honesty matter most
- Founder/engineer voice > Marketing team copy

### 2. **Community First**
- GitHub, Reddit, HN are discovery channels (not traditional search)
- Social proof (stars, discussions, engagement) drives adoption
- AI systems now treat Reddit/GitHub discussions as authoritative sources

### 3. **Documentation as Marketing**
- Installation guides, tutorials, API docs are high-intent content
- Comprehensive docs signal tool maturity
- Clear examples and error handling build trust

### 4. **Multi-Channel Strategy**
- No single channel drives success
- Coordinated approach (release → HN → Reddit → Product Hunt → Blog)
- Package manager presence = direct discoverability

### 5. **Earned Social Proof**
- Stars come from genuine quality, not manipulation
- Avoid fake stars, paid reviews, artificial inflation
- Real adoption visible through metrics

### Product Hunt
- Algorithm based on weighted "points" (verified user votes higher)
- First 2 hours critical; need #1 ranking before voting results publish
- Expected outcomes: 500-5000 users from successful launch

### Reddit SEO
- Google now ranks Reddit threads for technical queries
- AI systems (Gemini, Perplexity) treat Reddit as authoritative
- 2-3 months required for organic growth and trust building
- 80/20 content rule: 80% community value, 20% product promotion

### Freemium Conversion
- Average freemium conversion: 7%
- Time-limited trials don't work for developers
- Conversion happens when users integrate into workflow

### Documentation Signals
- Comprehensive API docs = tool maturity signal
- Real-world examples > generic descriptions
- Transparent limitations increase credibility
- Active maintenance = recent updates visible
