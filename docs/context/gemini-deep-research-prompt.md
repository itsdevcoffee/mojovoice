### 5. Specific Technical Deep-Dives

#### A. Mel Spectrogram Bug Investigation
**Current Issue:** Candle's `pcm_to_mel` generates 4500 frames for 480k samples instead of 3000.

Research:
- Is this a known Candle bug or expected behavior?
- What hop_length is Candle actually using? (appears to be ~107 instead of 160)
- Should we implement custom mel spectrogram generation?
- Performance impact of our current truncation workaround

#### B. Prompt Biasing Token Overflow

- Whisper's actual max prompt length in practice
- Techniques for compressing technical vocabulary into <50 tokens
- Alternative biasing methods (external LM, vocabulary injection)
- How do commercial products handle this?

#### C. Speculative Decoding for Whisper
**Goal:** 2-3x speedup via draft model.

Research:
- Open-source implementations (Medusa, EAGLE, Lookahead decoding)

- **Accuracy target:** Competitive with commercial tools (95-98% on developer vocabulary)
- **Privacy:** 100% local processing (no cloud, no telemetry)
- **Open-source:** All recommendations should be implementable with OSS tools

## Example of Depth Expected

For instance, when researching **Speculative Decoding**, I expect:

- **Benchmarks:** Actual speedup numbers (e.g., "2.3x faster on RTX 3090")
- **Implementation:** Link to working code (e.g., HuggingFace implementation)
- **Candle support:** Can this be done with current Candle APIs?
- **Tradeoffs:** Accuracy loss? VRAM increase? Code complexity?
- **Recommendation:** Should we implement this? If so, which variant and why?

Apply this level of depth to **every** major technique you research.
