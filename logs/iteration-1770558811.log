## ✅ Task #11 Complete

Successfully implemented the slide-in settings drawer component with all acceptance criteria met:

### What was built:

**Drawer Component (`ui/src/components/ui/Drawer.tsx`):**
- Slides smoothly from right side with 300ms cubic-bezier animation
- 400px wide, full viewport height
- Backdrop blur overlay (rgba(10,14,26,0.95) + 8px blur)
- Close button (X icon) positioned in top-right corner
- Keyboard accessibility (Escape key closes drawer)
- Click-outside-to-close (backdrop onClick)
- Prevents body scroll when open
- Neubrutalist styling (#151B2E background, 2px left border)
- Proper z-index layering (backdrop: 40, drawer: 50)
- ARIA attributes for accessibility
