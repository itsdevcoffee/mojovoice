## ✅ Task #4 Complete: Neubrutalist Card Component

**Implementation Summary:**

I successfully implemented the neubrutalist card component following the MojoVoice Style Guide exactly:

### Changes Made:

1. **Created `ui/src/components/ui/Card.tsx`:**
   - Reusable card component with TypeScript props interface
   - 2px solid border (#334155) with sharp corners (no border-radius)
   - Dark background (#151B2E) for neubrutalist aesthetic
   - Hover effect: border changes to electric blue (#3B82F6) with 20px glow shadow
   - 200ms smooth transitions
   - 24px padding for comfortable spacing
   - Optional `badge` prop for status indicators (positioned absolute top-right)
   - Badge styling: green semi-transparent background with border and monospace font

2. **Updated `ui/src/components/Dashboard.tsx`:**
   - Imported Card component
   - Added "Card Component Demo" section with SectionHeader
   - Created 4 demo cards in responsive grid layout
   - Demonstrates both basic cards and cards with status badges ([ACTIVE], [READY])
   - Used proper typography (JetBrains Mono for headings, Inter for descriptions)

### Verification:

✅ Build successful (2.31s)  
✅ TypeScript compilation passed  
✅ All 11 acceptance criteria met  
✅ Visual matches style guide specifications  
✅ Electric blue hover glow creates signature cyberpunk aesthetic  

**Commits:**

The card component is now ready for use throughout the application and maintains the Electric Night design system with neubrutalist styling.
