Excellent! Task #19 is complete. Let me create a summary of what was implemented:

## ✅ Task #19 Complete: Export and Bulk Actions

I successfully implemented the export and clear history functionality for the history modal. Here's what was added:

### Implementation Summary

**1. Export All Button (Left Side)**
- Downloads all transcriptions as JSON file
- Filename format: `mojovoice-history-YYYY-MM-DD.json`
- JSON structure includes: `text`, `timestamp`, `word_count`, `model_used`
- Shows success message: "Exported X transcriptions" for 3 seconds
- Disabled when no transcriptions exist or during export operation
- Uses browser download API (no external dependencies)

**2. Clear History Button (Right Side)**
- Shows inline confirmation dialog before deleting
- Confirmation has Cancel/Confirm buttons with neubrutalist styling
- Red accent color for destructive action warning
- Calls Tauri `clear_history` command via Zustand store
- Shows success message: "History cleared" for 3 seconds
- Disabled when no transcriptions exist or during clear operation

**3. Visual Design**
- Both buttons use ghost neubrutalist style
- Positioned in ModalFooter (Export All left, Clear History right)
- Loading states with spinners during operations
- Smooth transitions (150ms) matching style guide
- Confirmation uses inline pattern (no separate modal)
- Success states use green (export) and default (clear) colors

### Verification
- ✅ Build succeeded (1.53s)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passed
- ✅ All 12 acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Follows MojoVoice Style Guide specifications
- ✅ Integrates with existing backend commands
