Perfect! Task #20 is complete. Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## ✅ Iteration 20 Complete - Keyboard Shortcuts System

I've successfully implemented the global keyboard shortcuts system for MojoVoice. Here's what was added:

### **Keyboard Shortcuts Implemented:**

1. **Space** - Start test recording (when main screen focused, not in input fields)
2. **Cmd+,** (macOS) or **Ctrl+,** (Windows/Linux) - Open settings drawer
3. **Cmd+H** or **Ctrl+H** - Open history modal
4. **Cmd+K** or **Ctrl+K** - Open history modal with search input auto-focused
5. **Cmd+C** or **Ctrl+C** - Copy last transcription to clipboard
6. **Escape** - Close modal or drawer (priority: modal first, then drawer)

### **Key Features:**

✅ **Smart Input Detection** - Shortcuts are disabled when typing in input fields (except Escape)
✅ **Cross-Platform** - Automatically detects macOS (Cmd) vs Windows/Linux (Ctrl)
✅ **Tooltips** - Settings icon, View All button, and test button show keyboard hints
✅ **Auto-Focus** - Cmd+K opens history and immediately focuses the search input
✅ **Visual Hints** - Test button shows styled `<kbd>Space</kbd>` hint below
✅ **No Conflicts** - Shortcuts only work when app is focused, not when typing

### **Verification:**

- ✅ Build successful (1.50s)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ All 11 acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Follows React best practices
- ✅ Proper cleanup (no memory leaks)

### **Next Task:**

Task #21 - **Micro-interactions and polish** (button brutal shadow shift, toggle liquid morph, focus electric glow, loading animations, etc.)

**Commit:** `1da8b22`
