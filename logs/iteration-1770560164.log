## ✅ Task #18 Complete: Full history - Search and filters

I successfully implemented the search and filter functionality for the history modal. Here's what was added:

### **Key Features:**

1. **Real-time Search**
   - Search input with case-insensitive text matching
   - Clear button (X) appears when text is entered
   - Instant results using React useMemo for efficient filtering

2. **Advanced Filters**
   - **Date Range:** Today, This Week, This Month, All Time
   - **Word Count:** Short (<20), Medium (20-50), Long (>50), All
   - Collapsible filter panel with neubrutalist chip design
   - Filters combine with search using AND logic

3. **User Experience**
   - Results count: "Showing X of Y transcriptions"
   - "Clear filters" link when any filter is active
   - Smart empty state (distinguishes no data vs no matches)
   - Modal loads up to 1000 entries for comprehensive search

4. **Design Compliance**
   - Electric blue focus glow on search input
   - Neubrutalist filter chips with 2px borders
   - Active state styling with blue glow
   - Smooth 150ms transitions on all interactions

### **Technical Implementation:**
- Used `useMemo` for efficient filtering (only recomputes when dependencies change)
- Added state management for search query and filter options
- Implemented collapsible filter panel with toggle animation
- All filters work independently and combine with AND logic

### **Verification:**
✅ Build successful (1.60s)  
✅ TypeScript compilation passed  
✅ All 12 acceptance criteria met  
✅ Visual matches MojoVoice Style Guide
