## ✅ Task #10 Complete: Collapsible System Status Section

I've successfully implemented the collapsible system status section. Here's what was delivered:

### Created Components
- **`ui/src/components/ui/SystemStatus.tsx`** - New collapsible system status component

### Features Implemented
✅ **Collapsible section** with click-to-toggle header  
✅ **SectionHeader** with animated ChevronDown icon (rotates on collapse)  
✅ **Real system data** from Tauri backend:
  - GPU name (or "CPU Only" if no GPU)
  - Memory: formatted as "X.X GB / X.X GB"
  - Daemon status: ✓ Running (green) / ✗ Stopped (red)
  - Uptime: formatted as "3h 42m" style
✅ **Smooth 200ms animation** with ease-out transition  
✅ **LocalStorage persistence** - collapse state saved between sessions  
✅ **Neubrutalist styling** - 2px borders, bg-surface, proper spacing  
✅ **Positioned below Recent Transcriptions** with 48px margin  

### Design System Compliance
- JetBrains Mono font for all values (GPU, memory, uptime)
- Inter font for labels
- Electric blue (#3B82F6) for interactive elements
- Green (#22C55E) for success states (Running)
- Red (#EF4444) for error states (Stopped)
- Proper spacing (space-y-4 for rows)

### Verification
