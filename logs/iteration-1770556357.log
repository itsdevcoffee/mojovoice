## Summary

**Task #2 - Neubrutalist Button Component: ✅ COMPLETE**

I successfully implemented the neubrutalist button component with all required specifications:

### What Was Built

1. **Button Component** (`ui/src/components/ui/Button.tsx`):
   - Three variants: primary, secondary, ghost
   - Three sizes: small, medium, large
   - Brutal shadow animation (4px → 6px → 2px)
   - 3D translation effect (button lifts on hover, presses on active)
   - Loading state with spinner + pulse animation
   - Disabled state with 50% opacity
   - 150ms transitions throughout
   - Uppercase text with wide letter-spacing
   - Full accessibility with focus-visible states

2. **Demo Implementation** (`ui/src/components/Dashboard.tsx`):
   - Added "Button Component Demo" section
   - Showcases all variants and states
   - Uses Motion animation for entrance

### Verification
