Perfect! Task #8 is now complete. Let me provide a summary:

## Iteration 8 Summary

**Task #8: Transcription Card Component** ✅ **COMPLETE**

### What Was Implemented

Created a fully functional `TranscriptionCard` component (`ui/src/components/ui/TranscriptionCard.tsx`) with the following features:

**Visual Design:**
- 📝 Emoji icon in header for visual identification
- Title showing first 7 words of transcription
- Metadata: relative timestamp (e.g., "2m ago", "5h ago") + word count ("• 42 words")
- Preview mode: truncated to 2 lines with CSS ellipsis
- Expanded mode: full text with proper whitespace formatting

**Interactive Features:**
- Click card to toggle expansion between preview and full text
- Hover reveals action buttons (Copy + Delete) with backdrop blur
- Copy button: copies full transcription text via callback
- Delete button: shows inline confirmation overlay before deleting
- Confirmation uses neubrutalist brutal shadow animation

**Styling:**
- Uses existing Card component for neubrutalist aesthetic
- JetBrains Mono font for title, timestamp, and word count
- Inter font for transcription text
- Electric blue (#3B82F6) hover states for Copy button
- Red (#EF4444) hover state for Delete button
- All transitions use 150ms duration for consistency
- Brutal shadow animation on confirmation buttons (2px → 4px on hover)

**Technical:**
- TypeScript interfaces match existing `TranscriptionEntry` from appStore
- Proper accessibility: ARIA labels, semantic `<time>` element
- Responsive design with proper spacing
- State management for expanded, hovered, and delete confirmation states

### Verification

✅ Build successful (1.48s)  
✅ TypeScript compilation clean (no errors)  
✅ All 14 acceptance criteria met  
✅ Commits: `5b6eedf` (feature) + `9c8b36c` (docs)  

The component is ready for integration in **Task #9: Recent Transcriptions Section**.
