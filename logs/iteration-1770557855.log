Excellent! Task #6 is now complete. Let me create a summary of what was implemented:

## ✅ Task #6 Complete: Giant Test Recording Button

### What Was Implemented

I successfully implemented the giant "TEST MIC" button as the centerpiece of the Mission Control interface. Here's what was done:

**Component Features:**
- **Giant neubrutalist button**: 280px wide × 120px tall, centered on screen
- **Visual design**: Electric blue background, black border, brutal shadow animation (inherited from Button component)
- **Recording functionality**: 
  - Starts 5-second test recording via Tauri `start_recording` command
  - Shows loading state with "RECORDING..." text during recording
  - Stops recording and displays transcription result via `stop_recording` command
- **Result display**: Shows transcription in a neubrutalist card below the button
- **Error handling**: Displays errors in a red-themed card if recording fails
- **Proper spacing**: 48px margin-bottom to separate from future status bar

**Technical Implementation:**
- Used React `useState` hooks for state management (recording, transcription, error)
- Async/await pattern for Tauri IPC calls
- Try/catch error handling
- Leveraged existing Button component for consistent styling
- All animations and styling match MojoVoice Style Guide

**Verification:**
- ✅ Build successful (1.53s)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation clean
- ✅ All 11 acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Committed with hash `fa20394`

The button is now ready for user testing and perfectly integrates with the Mission Control layout from task #5!
