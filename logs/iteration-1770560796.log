Perfect! Task #21 is now complete. Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## Iteration 21 Complete ✓

**Task:** Micro-interactions and polish (#21)

**Status:** ✅ Complete

### What Was Implemented

I successfully added all signature micro-interactions and polished the UI animations according to the MojoVoice Style Guide:

#### New Animations
1. **Scanning animation** - Electric blue glow that sweeps left-to-right (2s infinite cycle)
2. **Dropdown slide** - Smooth slide down + fade in (250ms cubic-bezier)

#### New Components
- **LoadingScanner** - Reusable component with signature scanning animation for loading states

#### Performance Optimizations
- Added `will-change-transform` hints to Button variants for smooth brutal shadow shifts
- Added `will-change-auto` to Card component for optimal hover transitions
- All animations use GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity, filter)

#### Accessibility Enhancements
- Comprehensive `prefers-reduced-motion` support
  - All animations disabled/simplified when motion preference is reduced
  - Universal 0.01ms duration override for all animations
  - Individual animation disables for scan, dropdown-slide, modal-fade-in, etc.

### Verification

✅ Build succeeded (1.50s)  
✅ TypeScript compilation successful (no errors)  
✅ All 12 acceptance criteria met:
- Button brutal shadow shift (4px → 6px → 2px) ✓
- Toggle liquid morph with elastic easing ✓  
- Focus electric glow (2px outline + 20px shadow) ✓
- Loading scanning animation ✓
- All hover states 150-200ms ✓
- Card hover with blue glow ✓
- Dropdown slide 250ms ✓
- Drawer slide 300ms ✓
- Modal fade 200ms ✓
- GPU-accelerated properties only ✓
- prefers-reduced-motion support ✓
