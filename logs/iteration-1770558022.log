## ✅ Task #7 Complete: Status Bar Component

**Implementation Summary:**

I successfully implemented the status bar component as the centerpiece for displaying system status and quick settings. Here's what was built:

### Components Created:
- **`ui/src/components/ui/StatusBar.tsx`** - A comprehensive status bar with real-time updates

### Key Features:

1. **Real-Time Status Indicator**
   - Green dot (●) + "READY" when daemon is running
   - Red dot (●) + "OFFLINE" when daemon is not running
   - Polls status every 5 seconds for updates

2. **Interactive Model Dropdown**
   - Shows current model name with ChevronDown icon
   - Click to open dropdown with all downloaded models
   - Switch models with a single click
   - Current model highlighted in blue
   - Backdrop closes dropdown on outside click

3. **System Information Display**
   - Current language (from config)
   - Active microphone name (with truncation)
   - Clean layout with labeled values

4. **Neubrutalist Design**
   - 2px borders (#334155) with electric blue hover (#3B82F6)
   - Proper padding (16px vertical, 24px horizontal)
   - Electric blue focus glow on dropdown
   - Smooth 150ms transitions

5. **Typography**
   - JetBrains Mono for all values (model, language, mic)
   - Inter for labels
   - Proper uppercase styling for status text

### Integration:
- Positioned in MissionControl below the test button with 48px margin
- Integrates with Tauri backend commands: `get_daemon_status`, `get_config`, `list_downloaded_models`, `switch_model`

### Build Status:
- ✅ Build succeeded (1.54s)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation clean
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Committed: `b5e4554`

**Next Task:** Task #8 - Transcription card component
