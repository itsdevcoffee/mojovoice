## 🎯 What is Mojo Voice?

**Mojo Voice** is a lightning-fast, privacy-first voice dictation tool built for developers. Press a hotkey, speak naturally, and your words appear instantly at your cursor—no cloud, no latency, no compromises.

### The Problem

Typing code comments, documentation, commit messages, and chat responses is slow. Cloud-based voice tools are either:
- **Too slow** (network latency kills flow state)
- **Too intrusive** (your code goes to someone else's servers)
- **Too generic** (can't handle technical vocabulary like "async fn", "kubectl", or "GraphQL")

### The Solution

Mojo Voice runs **100% locally** on your machine with **GPU acceleration**, delivering transcription in under 500ms. It understands technical terminology out of the box and works offline. Built in Rust, powered by OpenAI Whisper.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🚀 **Blazing Fast**
- **GPU-accelerated** transcription with CUDA (NVIDIA), Metal (Apple Silicon), or ROCm (AMD)
- **5-10x faster** than CPU-only solutions
- **Sub-second latency** for typical voice commands

### 🔒 **Privacy-First**
- **100% local processing** — your voice never leaves your machine
- **No cloud dependencies** — works completely offline
- **No telemetry** — we don't track anything

### 🧠 **Developer-Aware**
- Understands technical vocabulary: `async/await`, `kubernetes`, `GraphQL`, `flatpak`, `systemd`
- Customizable prompts to bias toward your tech stack
- Language detection (English, Spanish, French, and more)

### ⚡ **Cross-Platform**
- **Linux:** Wayland (Hyprland, Sway, KDE) and X11
- **macOS:** Intel and Apple Silicon (with Metal acceleration)
- **Windows:** Coming soon

### 🎨 **Desktop Integration**
- **Waybar module** with real-time status (idle/recording/processing)
- Polybar support coming soon
- Systemd service for always-on daemon mode

### 🛠️ **Built for Power Users**
- **Daemon mode** for instant response
- **Toggle mode** (press once to start, again to stop)
- **Clipboard mode** for manual pasting
- **Keyboard shortcuts** via Hyprland/Sway bindings

```

### 2. Download a Model

```bash
mojovoice download base.en  # 148MB, balanced speed/accuracy
```

### 3. Start the Daemon

```bash
mojovoice daemon
```

### 4. Use It

```bash
# In another terminal (or bind to a hotkey)
mojovoice start    # Begin recording
# Speak: "This is a test of voice dictation"
mojovoice stop     # Transcribe and inject text
```

**Text appears at your cursor!**

## 🌟 Why We Built This

We're developers who got tired of:
- Typing the same technical terms over and over
- Slow cloud transcription breaking our flow
- Privacy concerns with commercial voice tools
- Lack of Linux-first voice solutions

Mojo Voice is our answer: a tool that respects your privacy, runs at the speed of thought, and understands the language you actually speak.

**If you think faster than you type, Mojo Voice is for you.**
