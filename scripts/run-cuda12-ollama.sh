# Wrapper to run dev-voice CUDA binary with Ollama's CUDA 12 libraries
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/run-cuda12-ollama.sh daemon
#   ./scripts/run-cuda12-ollama.sh start --duration 10
#
# Environment variables:
#   DEVVOICE_BINARY - Override binary location
#   DEVVOICE_DEBUG  - Print library loading info
#   DEVVOICE_STRICT - Use ONLY Ollama libs (ignore system LD_LIBRARY_PATH)

# Set library path
if [ "$DEVVOICE_STRICT" = "1" ]; then
    # Strict mode: Only Ollama (prevents Python CUDA pollution)
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/ollama
else
    # Normal mode: Ollama first, then existing paths
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/ollama${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
